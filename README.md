# Helix Sleep Challenge

## Instructions:

### 1.- Install Python3

### 2.- From the command line do: 

git clone https://github.com/web2py/py4web.git

cd py4web

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

./py4web.py setup apps

cd apps

git clone https://github.com/ferzeg3420/helix_challenge.git

./py4web.py run apps

### 3.- On a browser:

http://localhost:8000/helix_challenge


## TOOLS/frameworks I used:
* BULMA CSS
* SASS to customize bulma
* py4web
* vue.js

It's easy to deploy py4web for free via pythonanywhere, so it is ideal to do a showcase. In addition, it is extremely easy to use and organize. 

Bulma is a responsive framework that is very easy to learn and customize with SASS. 

I feel that with vue.js it is very easy to write clean javascript code.
